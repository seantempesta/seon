# Open issues — accumulated register + plan (2026-06-11)

Everything known-open after the 2026-06-10 refactor day (19 commits) and
the P8 measurement (5 paid runs, sha 1ca105a). One doc to plan from.
Board P-numbers in brackets; evidence lives in the P8 sweep logs
(`tmp/gym-paid-sweep*-p8.log`, `tmp/cards-1ca105a-run*.txt`) and the
session's commit messages.

## Tier 1 — fix before Friday's demo

| Issue | Evidence | Fix shape | Board |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Loop economy**: agents answer by turn ~3 then churn check-forms to the 20-turn cap (3/5 paid runs, ~15 wasted turns each) + 2-6 noise onward replies — **DONE 2026-06-11**: `seon.agent/replied-since-inbound?` derivation + loop halt `:seon.agent/halt :replied`; stub-llm state-flip hack removed (#22 zero-forms was already a stop policy, now test-pinned); live-proved (1 turn vs cap 20, scratch agent `aiR-2606111030`); REMAINING: terminates-under-cap predicates for S-32/S-12 (gym under user review) + reply-every-asked-turn wording amendment (proposed in P21 report) | S-32 run1 capped; S-12 B 16-19 turns | `run-agentic-loop!` gains "reply! landed this wake AND no new inbound → stop"; review the reply-every-asked-turn instruction wording; add terminates-under-cap predicates to S-32/S-12 | P21 #35 |
| **Error-handling legibility**: validators throw in `db/internal.cljs`, envelope catch lives in the face — 2 independent agents misread the contract from source (judge red 3/3, genuine) — **DONE 2026-06-11**: `transact!*` now wraps its WHOLE body (conn-resolve, validators, schema install, commit) in the catch→`commit-error-envelope`; contract test pins `internal/transact!*` called directly resolving to the envelope; ctx citations repointed at `src/seon/db/internal.cljs:499`; lookup-ref + bad-ref wording now leads with eid/transact-first and warns AGAINST re-registering an existing attr for identity; identity-everywhere steer applied to the ctx Common-shapes + my.kb exemplars (todo-ns exemplar deferred — `src/seon/agent/**` fenced to P21's agent) | S-12 judges 0-40 across all runs | Hoist envelope conversion into `transact!*` (truth becomes local); fix stale ctx exemplar citations (849-850/871-874 cite pre-split db.cljs:803); review warn fix-example wording (coached the S-21 re-registration flake) | P22 #36 |
| **Gym-world parity**: scratch worlds miss the my.kb ns-source rows (4/7 exemplar blocks); hand-maintained seed drifts from boot | live=7 blocks, gym=4 | Driver seeds via the boot's OWN fns (structural parity); then re-baseline S-32/S-12 (user: correctness > benchmark continuity) | audit in flight + #17 tail |
| **Transcript-render suspicion**: an S-12 agent narrated "the user's last message is missing from the visible transcript" — **VERIFIED REAL + FIXED 2026-06-11**: budget eviction was newest-first over ALL items, so ~14 capped eval rows (≈1.7k chars each) after the user's message pushed it past the 24k budget; messages are now EXEMPT from eviction (kept in chronological position, content capped at `message-render-cap` 4000), eval rows still evict oldest-first; pinned by `transcript-eviction-keeps-messages-under-eval-flood` | KoQ turn Ckz-2606101827 | Verify against the composer before dismissing (possible seon.ctx transcript-window bug) | folded in P22 |
| **Demo prep**: Thursday rehearsal + reset + seeding | script committed 014416e | Run the script's checklist; S-21 3-run stability probe pre-demo | P9 #24 |

## Tier 2 — context quality (gym-gated, the standing method)

| Issue | Notes | Board |
|---|---|---|
| capabilities section lacks the XML wrapper other sections have | uniformity canary; cosmetic | audit lane / V3-E |
| identity-everywhere exemplar steer | agents over-apply `{:seon.db/identity true}` (S-21 mutation flake, S-12 single-entity upsert) — one context iteration on the todo exemplar + warn wording. **Partially done with P22 (2026-06-11)**: ctx Common-shapes now presents identity as OPTIONAL (plain values first, "never re-register an existing attr to add identity"), both my.kb register! exemplars annotated with WHY identity, warn `check-bad-ref` + the internal lookup-ref translation lead with eid/transact-first. REMAINING: the `seon.agent.todo` exemplar's `::id` register! (fenced out of P22); gym-measured iteration | with P22 |
| `relevant-roots` growth to post-split faces | +~47k chars/prompt, deliberately deferred from P5; A/B gym run decides | after P6 |
| V3-D datahike API block | query API from var docstrings — querying is core, agents only see our wrapper docs | queued |
| V3-E show-don't-tell | sections → demonstrated evals (todo list-open, catalog query, my.kb consult, pull-own-entity); one section per unit, scorecard each | queued |
| S-21 instability | zero-register! flake 1/2 — partly the warn wording, partly plan variance; 3-run probe before declaring | with P22/P9 |
| **SOUL/system-prompt hardcoded** (user, 2026-06-11) | the SOUL-derived identity text is a compiled-in def at `seon.ai.deepseek/default-system-prompt` (deepseek.cljs:107) — uneditable without a rebuild, and identity content sits in a PROVIDER ns (placement smell: it isn't deepseek-specific). User directive: ANY user must be able to change this and control ALL content injected into context. Fix shape: load from an editable source — store entity seeded at boot from SOUL.md, same seeded+editable pattern as `my.kb.instruction` (one mechanism); the deepseek def becomes a read of it; SOUL.md the seed, the store the truth | new unit |

## Startup/restart reliability (user, 2026-06-11 — investigate)

Observed during the 06-11 morning restart; one investigation unit:

- `bin/seon restart all` excludes the JVM ("jvm not included") — a full
  system restart is two commands; either include it or say why not.
- The seon JVM MCP bridge caches a failed pre-flight across a JVM
  restart and keeps reporting "server not running" after nREPL 7888 is
  verifiably up (direct bencode clone succeeds) — requires a manual
  `/mcp` reconnect. The CLJS bridge self-heals (b8b3400); the JVM
  bridge should too (same fix shape: re-resolve on failure instead of
  caching the verdict).
- Post-start health check warns `:runtime-persisted {:instance-count
  0}` degradation 30s after boot — likely benign before agents resume,
  but verify and either fix the check's timing or document it.

## Tier 3 — platform (post-demo unless cheap)

| Issue | Board |
|---|---|
| P6 splits: agent.cljs → seon.agent + seon.agent.message (real ns for its keywords) + seon.agent.internal; seon.eval/schema/warn faces; deletes P5's transitional alias block (currently bypasses instrumentation) | #18 |
| stub-llm zero-forms termination (pairs with P21's stop policy) — **DONE 2026-06-11 with P21/#35**: zero-forms stop was already in `run-agentic-loop!`; now pinned by `seon.agent-loop-test/zero-forms-terminates-cleanly`; stub-llm's churn-causing state-flip form removed | #22 |
| :seon.turn/error attr — turn failure detail queryable (gym S-08 mechanical) | #23 |
| auto-run agent tests on fn update (tee fixed a53d2a6; the reactive section remains) + analyzer var-digest staleness | #33, P14(c) |
| gym harness: paid-gate anomaly (partial key list enabled all scenarios), async double-done (S-12 ran 2×), stub/paid question-text reuse | P23 #37 |
| small bugs: db-schema helper triplication; MCP tool-description drift (:repl vs :client) | P14 #29 |
| seon.agent.mcp (call the user's MCP servers) — user-wanted, post-demo | #25 |
| Timbre-unified logging; atom kill-list; tile/card unification (PARKED — label naming undecided) | #26 #27 #34 |
| DECIDEs: seon.dev.node-agent keep-or-delete; seon.log tail promotion; handlers.wake relocation | reorg PRD |
| wasm residue: mcp-server-seon still embeds a wasmtime pod; wasm-tauri dir rename + graveyard list (from the shell unit) | reorg PRD |

## Sequencing recommendation

Wed: P21 + P22 (+ audit lands, re-baseline) → S-21 stability probe.
Thu: P9 demo rehearsal on the fixed loop; freeze the substrate at the
rehearsed sha; only demo-blocking fixes after.
Post-demo: P6 → roots-growth A/B → V3-D/E (one measured unit each) →
the Tier-3 ladder in board order.

## What P8 proved (so the plan stays honest)

Consult-first 5/5 under stricter predicates; provenance storage +
cross-agent correction real; reply discipline transformed; zero
src-behavior regressions from 19 commits of refactor (every apparent
one was harness staleness). The costs are economy and legibility, not
capability.
