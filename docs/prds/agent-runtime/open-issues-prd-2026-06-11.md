# Open issues — accumulated register + plan (2026-06-11)

Everything known-open after the 2026-06-10 refactor day (19 commits) and
the P8 measurement (5 paid runs, sha 1ca105a). One doc to plan from.
Board P-numbers in brackets; evidence lives in the P8 sweep logs
(`tmp/gym-paid-sweep*-p8.log`, `tmp/cards-1ca105a-run*.txt`) and the
session's commit messages.

## Tier 1 — fix before Friday's demo

| Issue | Evidence | Fix shape | Board |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Loop economy**: agents answer by turn ~3 then churn check-forms to the 20-turn cap (3/5 paid runs, ~15 wasted turns each) + 2-6 noise onward replies | S-32 run1 capped; S-12 B 16-19 turns | `run-agentic-loop!` gains "reply! landed this wake AND no new inbound → stop"; review the reply-every-asked-turn instruction wording; add terminates-under-cap predicates to S-32/S-12 | P21 #35 |
| **Error-handling legibility**: validators throw in `db/internal.cljs`, envelope catch lives in the face — 2 independent agents misread the contract from source (judge red 3/3, genuine) | S-12 judges 0-40 across all runs | Hoist envelope conversion into `transact!*` (truth becomes local); fix stale ctx exemplar citations (849-850/871-874 cite pre-split db.cljs:803); review warn fix-example wording (coached the S-21 re-registration flake) | P22 #36 |
| **Gym-world parity**: scratch worlds miss the my.kb ns-source rows (4/7 exemplar blocks); hand-maintained seed drifts from boot | live=7 blocks, gym=4 | Driver seeds via the boot's OWN fns (structural parity); then re-baseline S-32/S-12 (user: correctness > benchmark continuity) | audit in flight + #17 tail |
| **Transcript-render suspicion**: an S-12 agent narrated "the user's last message is missing from the visible transcript" | KoQ turn Ckz-2606101827 | Verify against the composer before dismissing (possible seon.ctx transcript-window bug) | folded in P22 |
| **Demo prep**: Thursday rehearsal + reset + seeding | script committed 014416e | Run the script's checklist; S-21 3-run stability probe pre-demo | P9 #24 |

## Tier 2 — context quality (gym-gated, the standing method)

| Issue | Notes | Board |
|---|---|---|
| capabilities section lacks the XML wrapper other sections have | uniformity canary; cosmetic | audit lane / V3-E |
| identity-everywhere exemplar steer | agents over-apply `{:seon.db/identity true}` (S-21 mutation flake, S-12 single-entity upsert) — one context iteration on the todo exemplar + warn wording | with P22 |
| `relevant-roots` growth to post-split faces | +~47k chars/prompt, deliberately deferred from P5; A/B gym run decides | after P6 |
| V3-D datahike API block | query API from var docstrings — querying is core, agents only see our wrapper docs | queued |
| V3-E show-don't-tell | sections → demonstrated evals (todo list-open, catalog query, my.kb consult, pull-own-entity); one section per unit, scorecard each | queued |
| S-21 instability | zero-register! flake 1/2 — partly the warn wording, partly plan variance; 3-run probe before declaring | with P22/P9 |

## Tier 3 — platform (post-demo unless cheap)

| Issue | Board |
|---|---|
| P6 splits: agent.cljs → seon.agent + seon.agent.message (real ns for its keywords) + seon.agent.internal; seon.eval/schema/warn faces; deletes P5's transitional alias block (currently bypasses instrumentation) | #18 |
| stub-llm zero-forms termination (pairs with P21's stop policy) | #22 |
| :seon.turn/error attr — turn failure detail queryable (gym S-08 mechanical) | #23 |
| auto-run agent tests on fn update (tee fixed a53d2a6; the reactive section remains) + analyzer var-digest staleness | #33, P14(c) |
| gym harness: paid-gate anomaly (partial key list enabled all scenarios), async double-done (S-12 ran 2×), stub/paid question-text reuse | P23 #37 |
| small bugs: db-schema helper triplication; MCP tool-description drift (:repl vs :client) | P14 #29 |
| seon.agent.mcp (call the user's MCP servers) — user-wanted, post-demo | #25 |
| Timbre-unified logging; atom kill-list; tile/card unification (PARKED — label naming undecided) | #26 #27 #34 |
| DECIDEs: seon.dev.node-agent keep-or-delete; seon.log tail promotion; handlers.wake relocation | reorg PRD |
| wasm residue: mcp-server-seon still embeds a wasmtime pod; wasm-tauri dir rename + graveyard list (from the shell unit) | reorg PRD |

## Sequencing recommendation

Wed: P21 + P22 (+ audit lands, re-baseline) → S-21 stability probe.
Thu: P9 demo rehearsal on the fixed loop; freeze the substrate at the
rehearsed sha; only demo-blocking fixes after.
Post-demo: P6 → roots-growth A/B → V3-D/E (one measured unit each) →
the Tier-3 ladder in board order.

## What P8 proved (so the plan stays honest)

Consult-first 5/5 under stricter predicates; provenance storage +
cross-agent correction real; reply discipline transformed; zero
src-behavior regressions from 19 commits of refactor (every apparent
one was harness staleness). The costs are economy and legibility, not
capability.
